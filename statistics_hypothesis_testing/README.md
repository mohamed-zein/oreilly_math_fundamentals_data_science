# Chapter 2: Descriptive and Inferential Statistics
_Statistics_ is the practice of collecting and analyzing data to discover findings that are useful or predict what causes those findings to happen.
## Descriptive Versus Inferential Statistics
* _Descriptive Statistics_ is the branch we use to summarize data; calculating mean, median, mode, charts, bell curves, and other tools to describe data.
* _Inferential Statistics_ is the branch that tries to uncover attributes about a larger population, often based on a sample.
## Populations, Samples, and Bias
* A **Population** is a particular group of interest we want to study, such as _all seniors over the age of 65 in the North America_, _all golden retrievers in Scotland_, or _current high school sophomores at Los Altos High School_.
    * We have boundaries on defining our population.
    * Some of these boundaries are broad and capture a large group over a vast geography or age group.
    * Others are highly specific and small such as the sophomores at Los Altos High School.
    * How you hone in on defining a population depends on what you are interested in studying.
* A **Sample** is a subset of the population that is ideally random and unbiased, which we use to infer attributes about the population.
    * We often have to study samples because polling the entire population is not always possible.
* **Bias** means our findings are skewed by overrepresenting a certain group at the expense of other groups.
    * To infer attributes about a population based on a sample, itâ€™s important the sample be as random as possible so we do not skew our conclusions.
    * There are many types of bias, such as:
        * _Geographic bias_: in which we infer attributes about a population based on a sample from only one or few geographic locations while the population exists in many different locations.
        * _self-selection bias_: This particular type of bias where a specific group is more likely to include themselves in a sample.
        * _Confirmation bias_ is gathering only data that supports your belief, which can even be done unknowingly.
        * _Survival bias_ captures only living and survived subjects, while the deceased ones are never accounted for.
