# Chapter 4: Linear Algebra
## What is a Vector?
* A _vector_ is an arrow in space with a specific direction and length, often representing a piece of data.
* In its fundamental form, it has no concept of location so always imagine its tail starts at the origin of a Cartesian plane (0,0).
* The purpose of the vector is to visually represent a piece of data.
* Below figure, shows a vector $\vec{v}$ that moves three steps in the horizontal direction and two steps in the vertical direction.

* We declare a vector mathematically like this:

$$
\vec{v} = \begin{bmatrix}
x \\
y
\end{bmatrix}
$$

### Adding and Combining Vectors
* **Numerically**: simply add the respective $x$-values and then the $y$-values into a new vector

$$
\begin{align*}
\vec{v} & = \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix} \\
\vec{w} & = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} \\
\vec{v} + \vec{w} & = \begin{bmatrix} 3+2 \\ 2+ -1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 5 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}
$$

* **Visually**: connect one vector after the other and walk to the tip of the last vector. The point you end at is a new vector, the result of summing the two vectors.

* It does not matter whether we add v before w or vice versa, which means it is _commutative_ and order of operation does not matter.
### Scaling Vectors
* _Scaling_ is growing or shrinking a vectorâ€™s length by multiplying or scaling it with a single value, known as a _scalar_.

* Mathematically, you multiply each element of the vector by the scalar value:

$$
\begin{align*}
\vec{v} & = \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \\
2\vec{v} & = 2\begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 3 \times 2 \\ 1 \times 2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 6 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}
$$
### Span and Linear Dependence
* Using adding two vectors and scaling them, we can combine two vectors and scale them to create any resulting vector we want.
* Figure below shows six examples of taking two vectors $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{w}$, and scaling and combining.
    * These vectors $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{w}$, fixed in two different directions, can be scaled and added to create any new vector $\overrightarrow {v + w}$.

* This whole space of possible vectors is called _span_.
    * When we have two vectors in two different directions, they are _linearly independent_ and have this unlimited _span_.
    * When two vectors exist in the same direction, or exist on the same line, the combination of those vectors is also stuck on the same line, limiting our _span_ to just that line. This makes them _linearly dependent_, as shown in Figure below.

* A lot of problems become difficult or unsolvable when they are linearly dependent.
    * A _linearly dependent_ set of equations can cause variables to disappear and make the problem unsolvable.
    * If you have _linear independence_, that flexibility to create any vector you need from two or more vectors becomes invaluable to solve for a solution!
