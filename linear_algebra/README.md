# Chapter 4: Linear Algebra
## What is a Vector?
* A _vector_ is an arrow in space with a specific direction and length, often representing a piece of data.
* In its fundamental form, it has no concept of location so always imagine its tail starts at the origin of a Cartesian plane (0,0).
* The purpose of the vector is to visually represent a piece of data.
* Below figure, shows a vector $\vec{v}$ that moves three steps in the horizontal direction and two steps in the vertical direction.

* We declare a vector mathematically like this:

$$
\vec{v} = \begin{bmatrix}
x \\
y
\end{bmatrix}
$$
